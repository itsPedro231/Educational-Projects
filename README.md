All of these projects were made in my grade 11/12 Computer Science classes.

I selected projects that are entertaining or have interesting algorithms

Concepts envolving these projects:
- Insertion, selection, bubble and recursive sorting algorithms
- Encryption and decryption algorithms
- Recursive functions
- Array manipulation
- Text files manipulation
- Application of math formulas in programming
